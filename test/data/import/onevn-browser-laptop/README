Since Onevn browser-laptop is based on Chromium (via Muon/Electron), most of the notes from the ChromeImporter test data README (`../chrome/README`) are also applicable here.

# Generating test data

Unlike Chrome/Chromium, Onevn browser-laptop does not support multiple profiles, so if you use Onevn as your regular web browser, it may not be immediately obvious how you can create a separate profile for the purpose of generating test data. You can specify a custom user data directory with the `--user-data-dir` flag, e.g on macOS:

    TEST_UDD=/path/to/test/user/data/dir
    mkdir -p $TEST_UDD
    /Applications/Onevn.app/Contents/MacOS/Onevn --user-data-dir=$TEST_UDD
